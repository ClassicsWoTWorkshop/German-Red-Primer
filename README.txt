More may be added soon. Vehicles with very large wheels are more likely to receive this, but I'll add camo to ones that are requested.

IMPORTANT NOTES:
- More vehicles are planned for this pack; however, not all German vehicles will be added. The pack will consist mainly of vehicles which were historically either blueprints or prototypes. If you have any vehicles which you'd specifically like to see in this color scheme, feel free to request it in the above forum thread, and I'll have a go at making it.
- No icons are included as of yet. Since the vehicles in this pack have three separate colors, the icons will likely take a bit longer to make.
- Again, this is an early beta release, and probably will have bugs. If you find any, please let me know.

Enjoy!
